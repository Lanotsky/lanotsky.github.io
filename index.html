            <p><span>H</span>ello. I'm aaron, I do Front-end Web development. I do UI and UX, I've been doing design and layouts
            in simple HTML and SCSS as part of my job. I also do backend JS scriping on my spare time.</p>
            <p>I have a degree is business; majored in Operations. It got me intrested in how things work together and how 
                to build or improve systems. It was impossible for me to know that I would end up doing software but 
                it helped me sharpen my skills in what would be my line of work.
            </p>
            <p>I like puzzles, sports, action and I also love building things. From building model kits, to websites and alorithms
            I find joy in working with my hands.
